# Assignment 7.3.13: Times tables

This is a times tables program based on the `random` library.

It will ask for the biggest number you want to use (1 -> x).
It will also ask for how many excersises you want to generate, this will be limited by the biggest number (biggest number to the power of 2).
The program will then generate the excersis, when you press enter it will also show the results.
